N2  - Background: The global incidence of tuberculosis is decreasing, yet it remains high in Indonesia. The Indonesian National Tuberculosis Program facilitates mandatory notification, which enables early detection and treatment, minimises complications, prevents transmission, and decreases deaths. This study aimed to assess the characteristics, trends, and economic burden of notified drug-susceptible tuberculosis cases registered in this system from 2017 to 2019. Methods: We performed a multiyear cross-sectional study focusing on drug-susceptible tuberculosis notified cases, incidence, geographical tuberculosis case distribution, treatment outcomes, and costs in Indonesia using data from Sistem Informasi Tuberkulosis (2017–19). The settings were Indonesian health-care facilities that provide tuberculosis control programmes and services. Eligible patients were those who were diagnosed with drug-susceptible tuberculosis and notified to Sistem Informasi Tuberkulosis. Findings: Between 2017 and 2019, notified cases increased from 429 219 to 523 614 individuals, corresponding to an increase in incidence from 167 cases per 100 000 to 196 cases per 100 000. In 2019, more than 250 cases per 100 000 inhabitants were notified in Jakarta, North Sulawesi, Gorontalo, and Papua. Treatment success rate increased from 363 098 (84·60%) of 429 219 in 2017 to 452 966 (86·51%) of 523 614 in 2019, with a relatively stable mortality, changing from 3·15% to 3·05%. HIV status was increasingly confirmed, with unknown status decreasing from 66·21% to 43·68%. The costs of visits and monitoring and drug regimens were relatively stable, with total direct medical costs slightly increasing from US$39·40 to $40·40 per case. Interpretation: Progress was made on drug-susceptible tuberculosis management in Indonesia. However, further intensified efforts, including case-finding, optimising diagnosis, and cost-effective tuberculosis management are required if Indonesia is to achieve the 2025 WHO End Tuberculosis Strategy target incidence of fewer than 55 cases per 100 000 people. These data are an important starting point for understanding drug-susceptible tuberculosis dynamics in Indonesia and optimising its management. Funding: Directorate General of Higher Education; Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology of the Republic of Indonesia.

N2  - Problems with the management of city bus in Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia include the absence of a system that can detect and report the number of passengers in every city bus / bus stop. At present, the counting is conducted manually with a paper-based recording system done by two employees in general. This condition makes the passenger movement data and the report addressed to the city bus management invalid. In addition, a city bus passenger reporting system is required to facilitate the city bus passenger counting system so that passenger data can be obtained quickly, electronically stored, and easily analyzed for decision-making in the development of public transportation service. The reporting system developed in this study included detecting bus location, recording the number of passengers who get on and off the bus, and sending the information regarding the location and the number of passenger movement to the IoT-based data processing center. The system consists of RFID and IoT Microcontroller (Wemos d1 mini). RFID serves as the data entry of the passengers who get on and off the bus. Whereas D1 Wemos Mini will process the data of the number of passengers read by the RFID sensor, then the Wemos d1 Mini will connect WiFi to the access point installed at bus stops. After that, the data will be sent to the cloud database through an Internet network and displayed on the website. □ This system has been implemented and tested in real-time to find out the number of bus passengers. According to the test results, the information regarding passenger movements at every bus stop for one bus could be recorded properly. Thus, it provided important information in making decisions about the development of city buses as public transportation in Surabaya.

N2  - Generalized spatial modulation (GSM) maps its information to the index of the transmit antenna combination, making simultaneous transmission of multiple symbol possible. However, SM outperform GSM scheme in terms of error performance of the same data rate, due to average power effect. Transmit and receive diversity or the combination of both allow huge improvement in mimo systems in terms of error performance. In this paper, we investigate a near optimal low-complexity Euclidean distance antenna selection (LC-EDAS) technique in GSM system, to further improve the performance of the conventional GSM system. The LC-EDAS technique independently search across signal and spatial dimension to eliminate the worse channel prior to transmission. Secondly, we investigate a sub-optimal low-complexity transmit antenna selection (LCTAS) in the GSM system to further reduce the computational complexity (CC) imposed by LC-EDAS. The Monte Carlo simulation results obtained reveals a trade-off between the GSM scheme with LC-EDAS and GSM scheme with sub-optimal transmit antenna selection in terms of error performance and CC.

E-SIP possibly runs with using any browser supporting the java-script system. The development result of E-SIP is in terms of login page for users in three levels. The first level is Super Admin which is responsible to input all databases needed for E-SIP. The second level is Department Admin, which is responsible to arrange the individual schedule of departments. The third level is Faculty Admin, which only able to see the schedule arranged by Department Admin. The similarity of all levels is to print and see the schedule. The advantage of E-SIP is that the scheduling system is able to be controlled by online and performed simultaneously at one time as well as to check overlapping or nonautomatic schedules in the website. Besides, the disadvantage happens when there is a bug or an error resulting in that the system does not function properly and needs to be immediately resolved.

N2  - Early warning system aims to avoid and reduce the risk of damage and casualties caused by natural disasters. Landslides and earthquakes are natural disasters that often occur in Indonesia. The objective of the research is to develop landslide and earthquake early warning system applications for smartphone devices with Android operating system. Current smartphone contains low cost sensors able to detect movement. Despite of less accuracy than scientific instruments, but the ubiquity of smartphone can cover larger area. Crowdsourcing the data collection also reduces the false positive rate caused by the sensor. We embed our prediction model in Android application to distinguish between earthquake and common human activity. Further, the data is sent to cloud server if predicted as earthquake. When the number of user reported the same event at the same time in certain area met the threshold, push notification then delivered to smartphone user which may have impact by the event. We use data from Sistem Informasi Kebencanaan - Longsor by Research Center for Geotechnology to develop landslide early warning system. When smartphone user entering area with highly landslide potential, the would receive notification about the area potential. This research uses Agile method to develop early warning system on Android device. Research activities are conducted in 6 (six) phases: Requirement, plan, design, develop, release, track & monitor. In this paper, we described the process of design phase system that will be a guide in the next process in making the next program.

N2  - Background Data on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinical characteristics and severity from resource-limited settings are limited. This study examined clinical characteristics and factors associated with COVID-19 mortality and hospitalisation in rural settings of Indonesia, from 1 January to 31 July, 2021. Methods This retrospective cohort included individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 based on polymerase chain reaction or rapid antigen diagnostic test, from five rural provinces in Indonesia. We extracted demographic and clinical data, including hospitalisation and mortality from a new piloted COVID-19 information system named Sistem Informasi Surveilans Epidemiologi (SISUGI). We used mixed-effect logistic regression to examine factors associated with COVID-19-related mortality and hospitalisation. Results Of 6,583 confirmed cases, 205 (3.1%) died and 1,727 (26.2%) were hospitalised. The median age was 37 years (Interquartile range 26-51), with 825 (12.6%) under 20 years, and 3,371 (51.2%) females. Most cases were symptomatic (4,533; 68.9%); 319 (4.9%) had a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia and 945 (14.3%) presented with at least one pre-existing comorbidity. Age-specific mortality rates were 0.9% (2/215) for 0-4 years; 0% (0/112) for 5-9 years; 0% (1/498) for 10-19 years; 0.8% (11/1,385) for 20-29 years; 0.9% (12/1,382) for 30-39 years; 2.1% (23/1,095) for 40-49 years; 5.4% (57/1,064) for 50-59 years; 10.8% (62/576) for 60-69 years; 15.9% (37/232) for ≥70 years. Older age, pre-existing diabetes, chronic kidney disease, liver diseases, malignancy, and pneumonia were associated with higher risk of mortality and hospitalisation. Pre-existing hypertension, cardiac diseases, COPD, and immunocompromised condition were associated with risk of hospitalisation but not with mortality. There was no association between province-level density of healthcare workers with mortality and hospitalisation. Conclusion The risk of COVID-19-related mortality and hospitalisation was associated with higher age, pre-existing chronic comorbidities, and clinical pneumonia. The findings highlight the need for prioritising enhanced context-specific public health action to reduce mortality and hospitalisation risk among older and comorbid rural populations.

N2  - This article discusses the strategies used by five non-millennial teachers (aged 54-59 years old) of a junior high school in coping with the online teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic, in Ngawi, East Java, Indonesia. The teachers were interviewed, and the data were transcribed and analyzed by creating a data repository, expanding the codes, describing the coded data, and drawing conclusions. The results revealed that the teachers had several strategies used, which were to increase students’ interest in learning, provide students with knowledge and attention, create efficient learning resources, and use SIMPEL (Sistem Informasi Manajemen Pembelajaran or Learning Management Information System), which is specifically available only in Ngawi. SIMPEL was specially developed by the Ngawi district education office, to ensure that the learning processes in Ngawi Regency continue to run optimally during the COVID-19 outbreak. SIMPEL substituted the use of online YouTube videos and materials because the materials were already provided by the system, decreasing the need for the teachers to depend on other resources. Despite these teachers also using other online platforms, hence issues such as the slow internet connection, running out of quotas and blackouts, hindered their efforts to use these platforms at times. Hence, WAG was the most used media to conduct their online learning due to its simplicity and availability. These teachers continued to strive to learn digital technologies ever since they changed from their previous face-to-face teaching strategies.

N2  - The realization of the amount of zakat recorded in Indonesia is still very small compared to its potential. This happens because the existing information system has not facilitated and optimized the process of recording zakat in Indonesia by the Badan Amil Zakat Nasional (BAZNAS), Lembaga Amil Zakat (LAZ), and Unit Pengumpul Zakat (UPZ). This research focuses on designing the appearance and features of Sistem Informasi BAZNAS (SiMBA) which is currently the focus of the Komite Nasional Ekonomi dan Keuangan Syariah (KNEKS) in advancing zakat management in Indonesia. The Design Thinking approach is chosen because it is an approach that provides solutions to existing problems and is highly oriented towards user needs (Schallmo, 2018). By using the Empathy Map and Customer Journey Map visualization methods, the Usability Testing scenario test method, and the survey method of the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) in the Design Thinking stage, researcher can provide the most suitable recommendation for the User Interface of the information system to meet the users' needs.

N2  - Sistem Informasi Akademik dan Pengasuhan (SIAP) is an application web that facilitates the academic community in accessing information about academics and student care. However, in its development, if the code system is poorly written, a web application might have vulnerabilities. This study aims to determine the vulnerabilities found in SIAP using OWASP guide and how to fix these vulnerabilities. OWASP is the best choice because it can be obtained free of charge and freely on the internet and periodically up to date. Before vulnerability testing, analysis about security level of SIAP is done using OWASP ASVS. Then, OWASP Testing Guide is used for vulnerability testing. In the tests conducted, it was found that SIAP is vulnerable to injection, broken authentication, and broken access control. Injection is one of the vulnerabilities that has the highest risk value. After testing, a code review using OWASP Code Review Guide is performed to find the location of the vulnerability in the source code. For the last, a secure code recommendation will be given that can overcome the vulnerabilities found from the used guidelines.

N2  - Universities as educational providers need to provide good academic services for students. Academic services in the 4.0 era can be provided by creating an internet-based academic system. When a university does not have an internet-based academic service system, the university cannot provide good and quality academic services. This article aims at developing and analyzing academic services at universities by using an internet-based academic service system and Enterprise Architecture (EA). An academic service system called SIMANTAP (Sistem Informasi Manajemen Akademik Terpadu/Integrated Academic Management Information System) was made to implement in the academic service system at a university. The research method used was design-based research using the stages of defining, designing, developing, and reflecting. The research was conducted at four faculties at one university in West Java Province, Indonesia, which did not have an internet-based academic service system. The results showed that the utilization of academic service systems in universities has an important role in the process of conducting academic activities both for students, lecturers, and university staff. The academic activities were greatly helped by the use of internet-based academic service system. In its implementation, all users needed to know more and get used to using it, and the system designer needs to be responsive to anticipate any weaknesses in the system so that the academic service process runs well continuously.

N2  - The information system is a set tools to present information that has been managed well in order to make it easy and useful for its users. One indicator of the successful implementation of information system is how the end-user satisfaction. User satisfaction can be measured using user satisfaction methods. This study aims to develop a measurement framework to measure the user satisfaction of IT services. The measurement framework will be developed using 3 (three) basic theories such as Servqual by Parasuraman, Webqual by Barnes and Vidgen, and Information System Succes Model (ISSM) by DeLone and McLean. The model will be applied to a case study that an IT Service called Sistem Informasi Terintegrasi (SISTER) of the Jember University. This measurements using 100 respondents are students as SISTER’s users and will be tested using t testing and GAP analysis. Based on the measurement results, the variable service quality has no significant influence on user satisfaction, and another variable is website quality has a significant influence on user satisfaction. Based on GAP analysis, it’s found that the average gap value for service quality variable is-1.12, website quality is-1.00, and user satisfaction is-1.00. It means, the service quality that represents the tangible components, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and emphaty of SISTER’s provider according the students perceptions are still not good. In the future, SISTER’s provider need to improve the quality of measurement items of indicators of reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and emphaty if they want to increase the user satisfaction of SISTER.

N2  - The development of Denpasar, Badung, Gianyar, and Tabanan into a metropolitan area that is called in short Sarbagita can threaten the existence of community rice field land and agrar-ian culture considering that around 32.3% of the rice field in Bali is situated in this area. This study aimed at finding out the accuracy of Pleiades and Ikonos satellite image in mapping rice field land conversion, and producing a spatiotemporal map of rice field land conversion. This study used a quantitative descriptive method through image interpretation, field validation, and Geographical Information System (SIG) technique. The location of the study sample was in Badung Regency Sar-bagita Metropolitan area. The result showed that Ikonos and Pleiades satellite image has a 94.1% accuracy, which means that it falls into the very good category, so that it can be used for mapping rice field land conversion spatiotemporally. The spatiotemporal map produced shows that there has occurred a decrease in rice field area from 10,810.18 hectares in 2009 to 10,565.82 hectares in 2016. The rice field land conversion phe-nomenon tends to shift from that which was previously domi-nant in the south part to that in the north part.

N2  - Human Resources X Information System or "Sistem Informasi Kepegawaian X (SIPEG-X)" is a staffing information system that is used to monitor staff performance at a large public university in Indonesia. Since this information system was first developed, there has been no significant update on the system, especially if it is viewed in terms of user-interface (UI) or user experience (UX). This then led to the difficulty of assessing performance against the university staff because of a lack of satisfaction and comfort in using the information system. Therefore, usability evaluation and design refinement of these university staffing information systems was carried out using user-centered design methodology so that a new system in the form of a mobile application was developed to provide solutions to the interface of this staffing information system. Evaluation is conducted through surveys, usability testing, and contextual interviews to assess the usability aspects of the current implemented website application. The evaluation results show that the usability of these information systems needs to be improved and based on the principle of Shneiderman's Eight Golden Rules of Interaction Design, a prototype is proposed to improve the interface as well as the user experience.

N2  - Sriwijaya University (Unsri) as one of the state higher education institutions should be able to utilize information and communication technology in supporting various activities, one of which is in the learning process activities. One of the uses of information and communication technology at Sriwijaya University is by using an academic information system named Sistem Informasi Manajemen Akademik (SIMAK) of Sriwijaya University (Unsri). SIMAK is a mandatory system developed in 2008 to support academic activities in Unsri. Unsri has never evaluated the success factor of using SIMAK. Because it is a mandatory system, the success in carrying out academic activities depends on SIMAK application, so the researcher want to know what factors affecting the success of SIMAK usage on lecturer users. The research model used is a modification of DeLone and McLean information system success theory by adding several variables from individual aspects and organizational aspects. Data collection through a survey of 1232 lecturer respondents who were SIMAK users. The research method used is the mixed method. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is used to analyze data and SmartPLS as data processing tools. The results indicate the factors that affecting the successful use of SIMAK, namely information quality, service quality, system quality, self-efficacy, top management support, user satisfaction, and net benefits.

N2  - Background: Tuberculosis-diabetes mellitus (TB-DM) is a co-epidemic condition representing a double burden for high TB burden countries like Indonesia. Private primary care (PPC) in Indonesia was newly reintroduced to the TB program. Aims: This study explores the challenges PPC healthcare workers (HCWs) face in implementing TB-DM bi-directional screening and strategies to improve it. Methods: An explorative qualitative method was used by conducting two-round focus group discussions (FGDs) with HCWs (n=15) from five private clinics in Yogyakarta Special Region Province and triangulated with 10 DM patients and the TB program manager from the provincial health office. The data were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and subjected to thematic analysis. Results: HCWs face complex barriers in TB-DM co-screening implementation from patients, HCWs, and health system aspects. An integrated system to remind, support decision-making, report, reduce documentation duplication, monitor, and evaluate co-screening implementation emerged as a potential strategy, although some challenges to deploy. Conclusion: Albeit healtcare information system (HIS) is promising in enhancing integrated TB-DM screening and management, a comprehensive approach and multisector roles are still needed to overcome impediments to TB-DM bidirectional screening in PPCs.

N2  - This paper examines then criticizes legal arguments beyond the change in marriage age minimum limit in Indonesian case then proposing a new insight fur future regularion. It is a normative research with a meta-juridical approach. The primary data is Law Number 16 of 2019 and the SIPP (Sistem Informasi Penelusuran Perkara) report of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Indonesia analyzed using content analysis techniques. The results suggest that the legal argument for changing the minimum age limit for marriage as referred to in Article 7 of Law Number 16 of 2019 was motivated by assumption on the loss of women's rights, the increasing number of child marriage cases, and global pressures. From the perspective of a meta-juridical approach, the three factors are not appropriate arguments for changing the minimum age limit for marriage. On the contrary to the purpose beyond the change, the Article 7 of Law Number 16 of 2019 has rather caused the increasing child marriage after its issuance. Therefore, it is suggested that the standard for determining marriage age limit in the future regulation also considers the concept of of bâ’ah, ‘âqil, and bâligh which combine biological maturity and social responsibility.

N2  - Indonesia adopts two methods of capturing population data. First, by population census using data sampling technique by Statistics Indonesia (BPS). The second method is from the population data recording performed by individual residents. The latter is obtained when applying for their population identifications and Family Registration Card in the Population and Civil Registration Office using SIAK (Sistem Informasi Administrasi Kependudukan) or Population Administration Information System portal. Different data collection poses the potential risk of data discrepancy in the two institutions. It can lead to a more severe issue on the validity and accuracy of the population data. Additionally, the dissemination of population information remains centralized in the portals of both institutions. But these portals are not without limitations. Its dull visual formats in tables containing numbers are prone to data discrepancies and, in turn, may affect its reliability as perceived by the public. Based on these issues, the proposal as a solution is to develop a Web-GIS that integrates, visualize, map, and disseminate population data. WebGIS is created by using the Rapid Application Development (RAD) method to accelerate the development time, which is only 11 weeks/75 days, which helps minimize the cost and productivity resources.

N2  - Background: Immunization is critical to saving children from infections. To increase vaccination coverage, valid and real-time data are needed. Accordingly, it is essential to have a good report system that serves as defaulter tracking to prevent children's immunization failure. The Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta (DIY) Health Office introduced an electronic immunization registry and successfully implemented it for more than five years. It is the only individual-based record system in Indonesia that has been sustainably operated for a long time. Yet, no systematic assessment of this system has been conducted to date. This study examines the Sistem Informasi Imunisasi Terpadu (SIMUNDU) introduction and implementation process with a view to extracting lessons that could inform scalability and sustainability across the country. Methods: This study used an explanatory sequential mixed-method design, which collected quantitative data from 142 participants and qualitative data from nine participants. The data entry clerk at a health facility was systematically selected to participate in the survey, while in the key informant interview, the informant was selected based on the survey result. A descriptive and thematic approach was adopted to analyze the quantitative and qualitative data. Results from across the two approaches were integrated for comparison and contrast. Results: Findings are presented according to three core themes that emerged from the data: system strengths, potential threats, weakness and opportunities for scaling-up. Strengths, i.e., factors contributing to the success of SIMUNDU, include management, system performance, people’s behavior, and resources. Potential threats to sustaining the system include individual capacity, technical or system issues, and high workload. Opportunities – i.e., a promising factor that influences the SIMUNDU ability to operate sustainably – such as continuity, expectation, and the possibility of scaling up. Conclusions: SIMUNDU is a promising innovation for Indonesia, beyond DIY. There is agreement about the potential for scaling up this IIS to other provinces. The experience of implementing this system in DIY over the past five years has shown that the benefits outweigh the challenges, and SIMUNDU has grown into a robust yet user-friendly system.

N2  - The application of USLE model to several watersheds in Indonesia shows the diversity of processes that affect soil erosion. The integration of USLE model into Geography Information System (GIS) is able to provide a spatial distribution of soil erosion classes. This study aims to predict the soil erosion rate in various land cover in Ciesek sub watershed by integrating the USLE model into GIS. Undisturbed and disturbed soil sampling was carried out based on soil map unit, accompanied by observations of soil physic characteristics. Soil erosion prediction was done using the raster calculator with input raster-based data that has a certain spatial resolution. Analysis of the erosion class distribution on various land cover and slope classes was carried out by using the cross tabulation method. The results showed that the very low soil erosion class was dominant in the study location, namely in areas with forest land cover. The highest predicted of soil erosion rate resulted from bare land, followed by moorland and mix gardens. This research results are expected to be used for determining the priority location for soil erosion management.

N2  - Reliable digital-based laboratory management is a necessity in the current era of industrial revolution 4.0. Activities in the laboratory will certainly become more effective and well-organized with the existence of a reliable laboratory management information system. Therefore, we have developed a laboratory management information system under the name SIONLAP (Sistem Informasi Online Laboratorium Pendidikan). This system has been implemented in several universities in Indonesia. Given the importance of the user experience aspect and to determine the quality of the SIONLAP application, in this paper, we try to benchmark SIONLAP to measure reliability in terms of user experience. We used the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) framework as a measurement instrument and involved 60 SIONLAP users. This framework benchmark 6 UX aspects called: attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency, dependability, stimulation, and novelty. The results of the analysis and benchmarking of the SIONLAP user experience revealed that 2 UX aspects have the 'Above Average' predicate, 3 aspects have a 'Good' predicate, and 1 aspect has an 'Excellent' predicate.

N2  - Information technology has become a necessity for almost institutions, both public and private. There is no exception for boarding schools, especially Muhyiddin boarding school Surabaya. Various problems in boarding school need information technology to assist the jobs. One of them is problem in recording attendance of participants in a particular event such as Haul. Haul is an annual event that aims to celebrate the birth of Prophet Muhammad. Haul which was held in PP. Muhyiddin called more than a thousand participants who are the Quran memorizers (Hafiz). Haul committee must record the participants’ attendances one by one and place them into rooms (majelis) based on the order of arrival and city of origin. The existing information system is a desktop-based application that only can be used to record the participants’ attendances. The system has not been able to distribute the participants in to majelis automatically. While the distribution process is the thing that causes the attendance recording process takes a long time. Therefore, we proposed an Information System for Recording Haul Participants’ Attendances. The system is expected to be able to make the attendances recording process at Haul become more efficient. From the results of system testing has been done, within one minute the system can be used to record ten participants’ attendance, distribute the participants into majelis, and print ID Card for the participants.

N2  - Family Planning (FP) field officers are the people actively working in the field to encourage people to get involved in the family planning program that supports the government in controlling the population of the country. However, many of the officers have stated that their recruits often make mistakes during the process of inputting data along, added with the long manual validation process. The available digital reporting application called Sistem Informasi Keluarga (SIGA) is also not used at its maximum capability, causing the decrease of data validity collected through the process. Using business process improvement (BPI), valueadded analysis, and gap analysis are performed to find the issues in the system that will become the base of the reporting system redesign. This research was done to provide a proper business process design that is needed to ensure maximum comprehension and reduction of data invalidity with the help of the existing application. The result of this research shows that the new business process design required the digitalization of the data input process using an information system and the reduction of the use of offline forms to increase the validity of data in the reporting system.

N2  - Current procedure for updating the civil registration and population data in Indonesia has weaknesses that need improvements. One of them is the only written reporting procedure, submitted personally by the person in need to the civil registry officer. With this procedure, the accuracy of the data contained in the database SIAK (Sistem Informasi dan Administrasi Kependudukan-Population Administration and Information System) is very dependent on public awareness. This paper discusses a literature study of current government regulations and prior researches in the field of civil registration and population data updating procedure. It also proposes a new SIAK data updating procedure involving active public participation that can be done through a multi-channel telecommunications architecture. The architecture is designed as a complement to the official data updating procedure. This paper also reveals a number of important technical aspects that arise and should be considered in the new procedure.

N2  - Lack of information regarding the conditions of the roads and irrigation facilities is one of the factors contributing to issues with enhancing the productivity of food crops in the East and Central Sumba districts. The local government lacked the necessary information and standards to choose where to maintain those facilities. A Web-based GIS system as a part of a Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) is highly suitable for this purpose. A Web-based GIS architecture has been created using free and open-source technologies. PostgreSQL with the extension of PostGIS as a data tier, geoserver as a logical tier, and an open layer as a presentation tier. The Boolean model, a generic model in SDSS, is used as a multi-criteria option for local governments to choose an appropriate location to maintain road and irrigation facilities. Finally, our webGIS-based SDSS has already successfully been implemented in East Sumba, namely Sistem Informasi Jalan (SISINJA) and Sistem Informasi Irigas (SISDA) for road and irrigation facilities, respectively.

N2  - Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) is a disease that occurs in many developing countries and also on the list of 10 most diseases in hospitals. This study aims to analyze the information system of ARI Reporting Program in Surabaya. Reporting on ARI cases is a surveillance of the disease. If many cases reported, it is better than only a few cases reported. This research is a descriptive study with a qualitative approach. Based on the results of the interview with the informant, it was stated that the ARI reporting program had helped in recording ARI cases that occurred in Surabaya. File formats that are still manual and not integrated with the internet (online) make sending reports longer. Even if you implement an integrated online, data entry only needs to be done once so that the same data will be stored electronically and can be sent and processed. In addition, in the excel file ARI reporting program, there are several output menus that can be used as a result of the description of ARI cases. However, the output was underutilized so that less case monitoring was implemented to reduce the number of ARI / Pneumonia cases that occurred in Surabaya. The conclusion is the ARI reporting program is very helpful in the process of data collection of ARI cases, but it would be better if they use the type of online computerization management and better utilize the graphical output of the ARI reporting program.

N2  - Nowadays, almost every aspect of daily life cannot be separated from digital technology. Modern globalization has accelerated the development of information technology and information systems. Because the user has a specific need, organizations like BPK RI DIY are still resistant to manual document retrieval because they are inefficient and ineffective. This is because the user has a specific need. As such, the goal of developing the web-based application of Aplikasi Sistem Informasi Pengarsipan (E-SIP) is to facilitate archiving issuance. In this application, which was created utilizing the waterfall model, the front-end and back-end frameworks were ReactJS for the front end and NetstJS for the back end, both of which are based on NodeJS for databases using MYSQL. This technique uses the Black box for the GUI of the inactive archive application. Based on test results showing that the archiving application is simple to use and understand, it can be assumed that the application can help organizations like BPK RI DIY in archiving management.

N2  - Kulon Progo Regency is a district with a high case rate of 14.9 percent in 2021. Stunting is a disease that is the government's focus because it can threaten the nation's future generations. Stunting reduction efforts in Kulon Progo are mapped based on areas involving villages that are the locus of stunting. Handling stunting within the scope of Kulon Progo Regency is still carried out through two handling interventions: specific nutrition interventions to address direct causes and nutrition-sensitive interventions to address indirect causes. The handling of stunting cases in Kulon Progo Regency is also carried out by involving information technology. However, the use of this media has yet to be considered optimal and massive, which is shown by the lack of use by the community and related service delivery units. For this reason, through this development research activity, the proposer conduct a study on the opportunities and constraints of implementing the digital ecosystem, especially in accelerating stunting handling. This is so that monitoring and providing assistance to survivors and prevention can be carried out optimally and according to needs.

N2  - Pusat Penelitian dan Pengabdian Masyarakat (P2M Center) Politeknik Negeri Batam manages researches and community services activities for academic purposes. One of the activities have been conducted regularly is an internal funding for research and community services. Sistem Informasi Pusat Penelitian & Pengabdian Masyarakat (SIMP3M) has been provided as an information system to facilitate the activity. On a conventional system, a reviewer could assess the proposal, made a review and signed the assessment paper. However, current information system doesn't provide those processes. Authentication on the reviewer at a specific assessment as well as the assessment was nothing. Thus, the originality of the assessment process has been questioned. In this study, we proposed an implementation of digital signature on the SIMP3M to address the authentication issue. Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) cryptographic algorithm and (Secure Hash Algorithm) SHA were used as algorithm to build the digital signature. An avalanche effect analysis was used as a method to prove the concept. As digital signature has been proved to solve the issue, results show that about 90% the originality of assessment can be shown and authentication can be preserved.

N2  - The Integrated Resource Information System or Sistem Informasi Sumber Daya Terintegrasi (SISTER) is an application that acts as a source of portfolio information for higher education educators or Perguruan Tinggi (PT) in Indonesia. However, on the other hand, several universities already have a Personnel Management Information System or Sistem Informasi Kepegawaian (SIMPEG), which has a similar function and some data attributes that tend to be the same. Most lecturers usually input data on SISTER. The same data is sometimes inputted again into SIMPEG by staff in the personnel department. Apart from wasting time, this activity results in duplication of data, and sometimes errors in data input occur. So that the existing data in SISTER, especially related to lecturer profiles, is in sync with data in other systems, it is proposed to carry out system integration. The system developed is designed to display a portfolio of researchers, especially lecturers who are integrated with SISTER. The web service as a bridge connecting SISTER with the Indonesian Research Portfolio Information System or Sistem Informasi Profil Penelitian Indonesia (PROFLITIN), is used and integrated by utilizing the SISTER Application Programming Interface (API). Interoperability between systems is the main focus of this research. So that with the application of web service technology there will be no more duplication of data, it is enough to input the same data once and the stored data can be used for other purposes. There are 9 data items integrated in the experiment in this study, including: Profile Data, Education Level, Teaching Data, Research Data, Community Service Data, Publication Data, Scientific Oration Data, Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Data, Awards Data. Experiments in this study have successfully integrated SISTER with PROFLITIN. There are 42 data from research lecturers that have been successfully displayed on the PROFLITIN Information System. Apart from that the system is also designed to be able to display portfolio information in the form of a Curriculum Vitae (CV).

N2  - The geographical condition of Sungai Pisang Village located on the coastal fringe and not too far from the famous island tourism which potential in West Sumatera becomes an opportunity for the people of Sungai Pisang, especially the fishermen to increase their standard of living. But in reality, the outsiders in the Bungus area are more likely to take advantage of the opportunity because of their location close to the city center. The tourists can only be seen from far by biduk fishermen of Sungai Pisang. Most tourists prefer to use Tour and Travel services from Bungus area. Biduk fishermen are only bringing few tourists to the island tour even though the price offered is much cheaper. Based on preliminary study, there are problems such as the lack of knowledge of the fisherman on the effective product marketing strategy. So far, there are no marketing tools to promote the transportation services of biduk fisherman for the island tourism in the Sungai Pisang broadly. Therefore, it is necessary to design a marketing information system of island tourism biduk. The marketing information system is a mobile web-based designed using PHP programming language and supported by the MySQL database. The information marketing system is expected to increase the number of tourists who use the island tourism biduk as an effort to increase the sustainable fishermen's economy.

N2  - Electronic waste (E-waste) is currently one of the waste streams with the most significant growth rate due to the incredible technological advancement and greater use of information and telecommunications (IT) technologies. One of the main concerns regarding environmental contamination that people worldwide have is the management of electronic waste. This problem is due to the quickly rising use of technological devices. As a result, electrical and electronic equipment has a finite shelf life and eventually becomes outdated. Lack of knowledge regarding the amount of waste produced and the transit of materials is one of the problems Indonesian governments have while handling e-waste. This study aimed to outline the possibilities of producing electronic waste in Setu, Tangerang Selatan. Online surveys of respondents from households were used as the methodology, but just for appliances like refrigerators, air conditioners, televisions, laptops, and mobile phones. Since this problem becomes one of the most challenging parts of gaining the closest data to the actual waste stream, it is thought that this method is an effective way to gather the vast amounts of data required for the government to establish related policies. Fifty-two residences in Setu District, Tangerang Selatan City, were surveyed using a modified UNEP questionnaire. The study's findings revealed that in terms of quantity-78 units produced as opposed to 244 units of the products listed-mobile phones are the most frequently produced electronic waste. Meanwhile, the refrigerator accounts for the most significant percentage of e-waste in terms of weight, or 40.93%. The findings of this study help policymakers create a formal e-waste management system by allowing them to calculate the amount of e-waste generated in Setu, Tangerang Selatan. Additionally, the approach used can be a valuable, user-friendly tool to produce the closest actual data that are typically required by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, such as to develop a database that becomes a part of Sistem Informasi Pengelolaan Sampah Nasional (SIPSN) or National Waste Management Information System.

N2  - Consumer Price Index (CPI) is one of the economic indicators used to measure inflation. Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS) publishes a monthly CPI and inflation with a time lag of one working day. Policies based on the monthly inflation rate could be losing momentum as the events associated with inflation had occurred long before inflation or CPI was published. Therefore, it is necessary to calculate daily CPI to describe near real-time price changes. Nowcasting can overcome this issue by predicting daily inflation through predicting daily CPI. The calculation of daily CPI is done by entering daily data price of basic commodities in Sistem Informasi Ketersediaan dan Perkembangan Harga Bahan Pokok (SISKAPERBAPO), daily Jakarta Interbank Spot Dollar Rate (JISDOR) from Bank Indonesia, and daily Brent crude oil futures prices from Id Investing into a nowcasting model and validated by monthly CPI published by BPS. The nowcasting method used in this study is the Time Series Regression (TSR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) applied to predict daily CPI nowcasts in East Java Province. The performance comparison between TSR and SVR is evaluated based on the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (sMAPE), and Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD). SVR-Polynomial is the best method for predicting daily CPI.

N2  - CT-Scan examination for medical purposes makes a 24% contribution to radiation exposure received by humans. The contribution is due to the high intensity of the CT-Scan examination and the large dose given to the patient. In CT-Scan, some procedures require contrast media to observe specific organs and conditions. This study analyzed the effect of contrast media on the dose of Head, Abdomen, and Chest procedures in adult patients. The data were obtained from reporting patient dose data carried out by the hospital through the Patient Dose Data Information System (Sistem Informasi Data Dosis Pasien; Si-INTAN) for January and December 2020. The analysis was carried out to compare the dose range and the average dose of examination with contrast and non-contrast. In this study, the Volume Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDIvol, mGy) and Dose Length Product (DLP, mGy.cm) quantities were used to observe patient dose. The analysis results show that both contrast and non-contrast examinations have a wide dose range that optimizes. Based on the comparison of the average dose, it was found that for the quantity of CTDIvol, there was no significant difference in values for Head and Abdomen procedures. However, there was a significant difference in CTDIvol values on Chest procedures. In the DLP quantity, contrast media increases the dose given to the patient due to the number of phases in the examination. Regarding radiation protection, it is necessary to do a separate optimization for examination with contrast and non-contrast. The National Diagnostic Reference Level (DRL) determination needs to be separated between examinations with contrast and non-contrast to support optimization.

N2  - Office of Archives and Library of Surakarta City Government or Dinas Kearsipan dan Perpustakaan Pemerintah Kota Surakarta (Disarpus) is a government agency responsible for regional archives and libraries. Employee performance appraisal is the primary step and data to determine the quality of employee performance. So far, employee performance appraisal at the Surakarta City Archives and Library Office is still done manually, not using an information system, so it often causes some fundamental problems. These problems include data validity, security, calculation errors, and ease of activity approval. Based on these problems, an information system is needed to solve the existing problems, namely the design and manufacture of a performance information system. We call this application the SiOPIK Application (Sistem Informasi Penilaian Kinerja). The objectives of this SiOPIK application solution are: 1) Design and create an information system for evaluating employee performance at the Surakarta City Archives and Library Office. 2) Making an information system that agencies can use to determine employee performance. 3) As consideration for continuing the agency employee contract.

N2  - SIKK (Sistem Informasi Kebencanaan Kabupaten or Regency Disaster Information System) Magelang is a disaster information system developed by local government in Magelang Regency to support disaster management. Despite having useful features, as with many e-government services, it shows a low adoption rate. This paper aims to explore the barriers impeding the adoption of SIKK Magelang from the perspective of local risk managers and disaster volunteers. Preliminary data were gathered by scrutinizing related disaster management documents and SIKK Magelang reports and interviewing the information system's operators. Next, a half-day workshop was conducted with the help of BPBD (Badan Penanggulangan Bencana Daerah) of Magelang Regency to assess local risk managers' and disaster volunteers' awareness of, intention to use, and attitudes toward SIKK Magelang. Of the 150 people invited, 112 attended the workshop; however, 107 participants could be analyzed. We found that participants had a low awareness of SIKK Magelang and were unfamiliar with the disaster information system. After the trial session, however, they had positive attitudes toward the information system and were willing to use it in the future, especially in the context of supporting their disaster-related tasks. Our findings indicate that SIKK Magelang has the potential to be more widely used by local risk managers and disaster volunteers. More effort should be put into promoting SIKK Magelang, such as producing a clear tutorial.

N2  - The information technology (IT) has enhanced the effectiveness of the business processes in all sectors. IT has rapidly developed but becomes a technological disruption for the industries too. IT professional decisions are based on specific requirements and user needs. The investment bases are business processes and the IT alignments. The terrestrial border control systems of customs, immigration, and quarantine (CIQ) are still manual. The traveller passports or ‘Pas Lintas Batas’ (PLB) documents are collected, based on the customers’ handwriting on the arrival or departure immigration cards. These are challenging works for the officers in organising the archiving, retrieving data, and developing reports. The researchers use AS-IS and TO-BE methodology within the software development lifecycle and aim to produce an effective, efficient, and secure ‘Sistem Informasi Pelintas Batas Wilayah Indonesia’ (SINTASWIN) prototype. This prototype application system is user and environmentally friendly, cross-platform, and has a high return on investment.

N2  - This paper proposes a requirement analysis to integrate two information systems used by the Ministry of Finance, Republic of Indonesia. The first system is the State Budget and Treasury System called as the SPAN (Sistem Perbendaharaan dan Anggaran Negara), managed by the General Directorate of Treasury. The second one is the Procurement General Plan Information System called as the SIRUP (Sistem Informasi Rencana Umum Pengadaan), managed by the Government Procurement of Goods and Services Policy Board or known as LKPP (Lembaga Kebijakan Pengadaan Barang dan Jasa Pemerintah). The two systems enable the procurement and finance management process of the national treasury. However, currently the both systems are not yet integrated, which causes much asymmetric information between the two. This study qualitatively analyses the opportunities to integrate their business processes and data flows, to overcome the current problems. Action research and thematic analysis research methods are used. The authors present the analysis results in two levels data flow diagram. Moreover, this study also analyse the opportunities for the application integration to improve the accountability and accuracy of the government financial management.

N2  - Drug and supplies management plays an important role in health systems. A web-based drug management information system, Sistem Informasi Pengelolaan Obat (SIPO) was developed to support interaction and communication among the internal entities of a district health office (DHO), including primary health centers (PHC). Using a qualitative approach, the objective of this descriptive study is to assess SIPO’s performance in terms of success in addressing problems related to drug and medical supplies management. The results indicate that SIPO has a positive impact for both PHCs and the DHO. The result found that the users are satisfied with the system. One element that needs to be improved is integration ability; currently, SIPO cannot connect to other health-related information systems. Generally, SIPO is considered to have a positive impact, both individually and on the organization.

N2  - The purpose of this study is to determine the quality of financial reporting of Regional Governments in West Java which have been written by implementing Regional Goverments Accounting Information System/Sistem Informasi Pengelolaan Keuangan Daerah (SIPKD). The success of the recent SIPKD accounting information system should be supported by competence and organizational culture in each regional government. To achieve the goal, the researcher conducted surveys in all regencies/cities in as well as province of West Java in 2017. The data was analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) by Smart PLS software. The results of the study confirm that the success of SIPKD implementation is affected by staff competence and organizational culture, whereas the quality of financial reports is affected by the success of SIPKD implementation, but is not determined by organizational culture and staff competence. The results of this study show that SIPKD brings a very good affect on the financial reporting quality of regional governments.

N2  - It is an undeniable fact that the advancement of information technology has provided an excellent problem solving related to managing spatial information nowadays. Unfortunately the advancement of this technology has not been used to the outmost due to the lack of implementation in the area of Spatial and Regional Planning in Indonesia. Indonesian government has approved the Act No. 26 of 2007 which has mandated all the provinces, districts, and the city should have the Spatial Plan and Detailed Spatial Plan for development in the area can be properly implemented. To realize the implementation of appropriate spatial planning law, local governments still have to face issues that are considerably basic; this is the lack of human resources in the understanding and implementation of spatial planning. On the other hand demands that society is based on the awareness of the function and role of good spatial planning has also increased. Based on these facts an application where the spatial arrangement can be acceptable to all parties needed to be supported by regular, consistent, and sustainable efforts. One of the efforts is developed by this study, namely developing the Provincial Spatial Planning Database System (Sistem Informasi Tata Ruang, SIMTARU) through Regional Spatial Development Implementation in South Sulawesi Province which is activity-based WEB GIS database preparation. This activity is closely associated with aspects of land use district / city in the province of South Sulawesi. The application system is developed to focus on the data collectivity and the enhancement of the system capability. Data collectivity includes entry and data integration compiled by the operators to the users. The main emphasis of this database development study is more on data base management systems and WEB GIS application program. Data were collected and integrated into a system of basic data of a general nature, such as base maps, satellite image data, map forest areas and public infrastructure data and its attributes. The challenge of this study is to publish the database to the web using programming language of PHP-Mapserver and continuously updating the database. Coordination among the sub provincial level (kabupaten) is highly concerned in the data collectivity. In conclusion, some functions of spatial analysis in the system have not been developed to the fullest which is therefore there are a lot of spares for further development.

N2  - The e-government initiatives in Indonesia has been increased for the last 2 - 3 years, and deal with many constraints of e-government implementation. One of this initiatives is how to develop a program called "e-government incubator", and implementing the application 'Integrated SIMDA' (Sistem Informasi Daerah) as part of program that would support the "e-government incubator" activity. This paper will describe the background, basic idea, content design and approach in development and implementation of Integrated SIMDA, as a case of e-government initiatives in West Java Province Indonesia. The main idea of Integrated SIMDA is to prepare a tool for facilitate collecting and disseminating information from the basic level of society, in this case, from sub district (kecamatan). Main issue in government performance evaluation was chosen to define the priority of information requirement that should deliver by the system, especially how the system can provide sufficient information to calculate Human Development Index. Integrated SIMDA was not expected as perfect solution, but it just an embryo for extended and larger system to integrate all required information. To support this purpose, the approach of "growing house" was selected as strategy for development content and features, and implementation the system. This approach was chosen because the user need flexible way to modify and customize the application based on localized requirement. At implementation stage, the government has a plan to build mutual partnership with local university/academy in providing the competent human resource as initiator and facilitator for end user. © 2010 ACM.
